title: A Curious Beginning
---

Hi, I'm Colin, and welcome to **_Deeply Curious_**, where I have way too much fun playing with deep learning and AI. 

Today, We Ask: "If I fed my own face into Nvidia's StyleGANs, could I generate an "anti-me", a face which is the exact opposite of my own?"

So I gave it a shot. And I decided that, before I generated the "anti-me", I wanted to know: "can I make it generate my _actual_ face?" 

Turns out, yes! 

...well, kinda.

Writeup coming soon. Sneak Preview: ![11k_iterations_256x256_200ms_stylegan_me.gif]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/11k_iterations_256x256_200ms_stylegan_me.gif)

2019-4-6 edit: changed the name to "Deeply Goofy", which I like better!
2020-04-04: ehh... Deeply Curious is more reflective.
