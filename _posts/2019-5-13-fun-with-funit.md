title: Sidequest - Fun with FUNIT
---

Very quick post: 
NVIDIA makes the best deep learning toys. Latest one is [GANimal](http://nvidia-research-mingyuliu.com/ganimal) (formerly Petswap), which lets you upload a picture of your pet, and transform it to look like other animals. 
So I uploaded a picture of my face instead:
![Me, as various animals]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/goofing_around/funit/FUNIT_COLIN.png)*Me, transformed to many 16 different animals* 

That is all. :P
