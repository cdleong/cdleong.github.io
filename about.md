A salutation to you!

I'm Colin. I'm a curious guy, and I also like learning new things! Especially about AI and deep learning.

Learning about meta-learning also amuses me. I wonder if there's any way I could learn how to learn about meta-learning better...

### Acknowledgements
This blog was inspired in large part by [AI Weirdness](http://aiweirdness.com). Have a look, it's delightful.

[XKCD](https://xkcd.com) has a special place in my part, especially the what-if series. My favorite is probably the one about the [Laser Pointer](https://what-if.xkcd.com/13/)

God, for inventing the universe, and giving me a brain to enjoy it with. He [hung over the deep](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1:2&version=ESV) before it was cool. To paraphrase _Chariots of Fire_ a bit... "God made me for a purpose, but he also made me smart. And when I think, I feel His pleasure." To Him be the Glory.
