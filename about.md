A salutation to you!

I'm Colin. I'm a very curious person, often reading articles or books, or tinkering with code. Sometimes to the point of being easily distracted. Deep learning is a particularly fascinating subject lately, thus the name of the blog! 

Learning about meta-learning also amuses me. I wonder if there's any way I could learn how to learn about meta-learning better...


# Philosophy of the Blog.

I'd like this to be a repository of cool and interesting things that I've found, as well as a place to publicly "think aloud" in a way that may be of use to myself and to others. I wish to live an "open-source" life, being very honest and open about my thoughts, inviting feedback, and holding a dialogue with the world. 

To paraphrase [the apostle Paul](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A16&version=ESV), I am not ashamed of the gospel I believe in. Rather, because of how it has saved me, I wish to share it with others.

And to quote Patrick Henry: "...in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate".

# Thoughts 
* See [Known Issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/known_issues/) for a list of problems or flaws with me that I wish to improve. 
* [Things God has Done]({{ site.baseurl }}/things_god_has_done/): God's done a lot for me. I record a few items here.
* [Why I Trust God]({{ site.baseurl }}/thoughts/why_i_trust_god/): My journey of faith thus far. 
* [Interesting Problems]({{ site.baseurl }}/problems/): Important problems or interesting questions I find meaningful, and I'd like to help solve.

# Whimsy
[I love programming!]({{ site.baseurl }}/i-love-programming) My love life with respect to programming languages.

[The Song of The True Twenty-Two-"Two-Tuples" Tuple]({{ site.baseurl }}/the-song-of-the-twenty-two-two-tuple-tuple/) A syntactically valid limerick, exploring a quirk of Pythonic truthiness.

[Quotes I like!]({{ site.baseurl }}/thoughts/quotes/): fun or interesting quotes.

### Acknowledgements
This blog was originally inspired in large part by [AI Weirdness](http://aiweirdness.com). Have a look, it's delightful!

For the structure and style I am inspired in large part by [gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About). His ideal of creating "stable long-term essays which improve over time" is fascinating, and I'd like to emulate it here.

[XKCD](https://xkcd.com) has a special place in my part, especially the what-if series. My favorite is probably the one about the [Laser Pointer](https://what-if.xkcd.com/13/)

God, for inventing the universe, and giving me a brain to enjoy it with. He [hung over the deep](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1:2&version=ESV) before it was cool. To paraphrase _Chariots of Fire_ a bit... "God made me for a purpose, but he also made me smart. And when I think, I feel His pleasure." To Him be the Glory.

And yes, I do belive this is a rational belief to have. For more on why I trust God, see [Why I Trust God]({{ site.baseurl }}/thoughts/why_i_trust_god/)

### Apps and Projects

#### Random Psalm
I made a web app! [Visit here for a random psalm](http://random-psalm.appspot.com/)

Alternatively, let's see if this works: 
<p onload="myFunction()">Click the button to get a link to a random Psalm</p>

<!-- uses https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp as basis -->
<button onclick="myFunction()">New Random Psalm</button>
<p id="psalm"></p>
<script>
function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementById("psalm");
  psalm_num = Math.floor((Math.random() * 150) + 1);
  x.innerHTML = "<a href=https://www.esv.org/Psalm+"+psalm_num +">Random Psalm is: "+ psalm_num +"</a>";
}
</script>

<script>myFunction()</script>
