> "Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: 'How did he do it? He must be a genius!'" [Attributed to Gian-Carlo Rota](http://themattheweffect.org/tag/richard-feynman/)

I'd like to collect problems here that interest me. This list may grow.

How can we most helpfully speed up the translation of knowledge into "low-resource" languages? Especially those that literally have no written language at _all_, let alone reams of text data?
* Unsupervised Machine Translation techniques? Word embeddings. See Ruder, Artetxe, etc.
* Work with existing translation tools and workflows, incrementally training "suggester" models?
* Could we train an audio-to-morpheme model? <--- this could be the first step to a "universal translator" that teaches itself new languages. Go to a village, leave the audio recorder running, and just train from there...
